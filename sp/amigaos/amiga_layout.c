/*
 * Struct layout cross-check.
 *
 * The game code is compiled with -malign-int (its data files, such as
 * the bots' .aas files, are laid out with 4-byte aligned ints), while the
 * amiga_*.c files that talk to the operating system are not, because the
 * NDK structures (Window, InputEvent, ExecBase, ...) assume 2-byte
 * alignment. The structures the two sides share must come out the same
 * either way. The Makefile compiles this file once with each set of
 * flags, and main() compares the results at startup.
 *
 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
